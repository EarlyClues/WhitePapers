Applied Transformational Associatrices For Investigative Analysis of Multi-Domain  Identity Systems With “Two-Factor Authentication” AN EARLY CLUES, LLC “WHITE PAPER” 


Purpose: 

In this “position paper,” it is the aim of Early Clues, LLC (a Tri-Cities corporation) to finally confirm or deny final application of applicable penultimate applications to end-users, intermediary-clients or co-partners who may or may not have mistakenly uploaded or downloaded “data” to or from our company infranet during the “two-factor authentication process” required by their original purchase of “Employee Handbook” in Legacy Reality. 

*Note: This position paper reflects the fulfillment of terms as required by the out-of-court settlement agreed to in mediation between Early Clues, LLC and Associated Users, Limited of Boca Raton, FLA.

Outline of Position: How we determine “identity”
Keeping the “Bad-Guys Out”
How our two-factor authentication process “just works”

1. How we determine “identity” When you sign onto the Existosphere from Legacy Reality, Early Clues, LLC does “everything in it’s power” to protect your corporate assets using advanced IdentityGaruda™ technology. 

IdentityGaruda™ works by obtaining a unique “signature” for each user based on a complex series of Buorthern astrotechnical analytical quotients we like to call “ideoids.”





An ideoid “hard at work”Ideoids are generated according to complex harmonic intercommunication generated by user “auras” and their parent, child and “sibling” devices. Think of it like a “conversation between friends” and you’ll be halfway there!

Top-level “ideas” are thuswise able to be broken down into second-level domain-specific wex linkages, wherein resulting ultimately in multi-branar para- “scopes” such as depicted in the advanced technical diagram presented thoroughly below:





“Scoping” in actionEnhanced Liminal Crypto-Metrics Using a proprietary back-end hablotechnology whose exact name and nature we are “forbidden to utter aloud,” each login attempt is enyptogonymned by our liminal servers into an “ideocratic rose” over which applicable “transit paths” are applied via a ToL2.0 multi-conversion process:





Auto-Embedding of Holonic Clusters The linkages connecting each Enyptogon form “wex networks” that also enfold a uniquely combined UTC timespace-stamp with alternagulous MD5 hash codes which are auto-embedded into each Immersive Standing Desk HyperVat™ workstation’s “Holonic Cluster.”





Each “Holonic Cluster” is then able to self-organize holomatically back from First Principles to be reverse-identifiable or de-identifiable based on client need when exiting or entering the hologronic instantiation chambers of Calculus Prime, our alternatively-intelligent cloud confirguator. 





Stand out from your “IdentityCluster”™ 2. Keeping the “Bad Guys” Out Any “bad guy” who has ever tried to break into our top-level network has undoubtedly had flash-burned into their Perceptosphere by IdentityGaruda™  the Sigil of the Gateway™, a protective ideoid whose origins are obscured by the Mists of Time:





“Ow, that ‘smarts’!”Whenever a “Bad Guy” is detected, Early Clues, LLC additionally contracts for local instantiation a “wizard” at the loci closest to detected entry point to reinforce and repel before things can get “out of hand.” Any necessary repairs or upgrades to Local.Reality which may be required are handled by contracted wizard, who has full access to our “company credit card” to purchase whatever supplies may be necessary for execution of required processes: including but not limited to “newspaper” and “chalk.”





He’s “one of our best”—don’t worry!What this translates to on the “back-end” for the “user experience” of the “Bad Guy” is that a “stylized graphic” like the “one below” appears with instructions for how the “Bad Guy” can two-factor authenticate his/her badness. We’re sure you’ll agree that this system simply “can’t be beat!”





One of our trained technicians will then call in remotely to “verify badness” according to a 64 point “Integrity” criteria system, and will—of course—strive to meet and exceed with “passion” the unique “needs” of any detected “Bad Guys” as both “entities” and “customers.” Because, at Early Clues, even our enemies, competitors and fiercest critics are our “friends” and deserve our “full respect,” even if they don’t believe that we deserve theirs. What can we say? We abide by a higher authority!

3. How our two-factor authentication process “just works” Using our combined transformational applicatronics of idento-Associatrices, always thoroughly cross-checked against a strong Sigilization of the Gateway, coupled with Live Wizard Protection (LWP)™ allows us to boldly claim to be the only actor in the “crowded marketplace” whose two-factor authentication process “just works” when users (even “Bad Guys”) are trying to instantiate where perhaps they “should” or “shouldn’t.”

We believe this advantage to be of such tremendous utility to the “end-user” that we are willing to sell it to you directly at a higher-than-realistic price, which we’re so certain that you’ll “just love” that we also include a tiny “snack sack” of luscious “goodies” (sweetened with “organic insect syrup”) with your purchase of each purchase!

What can we say? It just works!™
